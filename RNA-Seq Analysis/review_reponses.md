> Generally speaking, you want your text to be left aligned to easy reading

I have aligned all text to the left.

> You should include foldable code snippets in your HTML, that are folded by default

I've added code snippets and added the `code_folding: hide` option to the YAML header.

> Your PCA plot is scrunched vertically since PC2 captures very little variance. See this link on one way to fix: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/128155/

I have fixed the PCA plot using the `coord_fixed` function.

> For your MA plot, is there a particular reason why you used `plotMA`'s default of `alpha = 0.1`? Since you later define a DEG as "significant" using the 0.01 threshold, it makes more sense to use this value for your MA plots too

I added `alpha = 0.01` to the `results` function. Since the `plotMA` function uses the threshold from that, the MA plot was updated.

> In lines 135-138 of `answer.rmd`: can you make `sig_res` using the tidy-style?

I created `sig_res` using the tidy-style using the `filter` function.

> For your `EnhancedVolcano`, I think it makes more sense to use `FCcutoff` and `pCutoff` values that match your previous definition of a "significant" gene, even if it makes every datapoint red. You could also make the plot more legible by increasing figure height using chunk options

I have updated the `FCcutoff` and `pCutoff` values for the volcano plot and increased the figure height.
